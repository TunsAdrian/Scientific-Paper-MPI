# ScientificPaper-MPI
This is a scientific paper about sorting algorithms behaviour, that I had to write in my first college year. The paper follows an experimental and analytical comparison of three common sorthing algorithms(insertion,quick and heap). It was writted in Texmaker.

There is also a folder with reviews I had to write for three other papers from my colleagues(the paper were randomly assigned to us).
