\begin{abstract}
	This article shows an algorithm to review scientific paper. It explains step-by-step how one should review a paper and when should he drop a paper.
\end{abstract}
\newpage

1)Read abstract, introduction and conclusion(around 10 minutes)

2)If the paper is in the scope(of journal, of call of papers etc.):
\begin{itemize}
\item then "the paper is in the scope", go to 3)
\item else describe the topic of the paper including justification for "not in the scope", *STOP*
\end{itemize}

3)Read superficially the paper(around 15 minutes) and write a summary which includes problem and solution(results) of the paper, in your own words(around 5 minutes)

4)If the presentation of the paper seems clear enough for making a fair evaluation:
\begin{itemize}
\item then go to 5
\item else "reject, presentation is to poor to..."(justify), *STOP*
\end{itemize}

5)If the main results seem important:
\begin{itemize}
\item then "the main results(which) seem (very, fairly, quite etc.) important", go to 6)
\item else "reject, results are not important(enough)" *STOP*
\end{itemize}

6)If the results seem non-trivial:
\begin{itemize}
\item then "the main results(which) are non-trivial(in what way?), go to 7)
\item else "reject, results are trivial(how?)", *STOP
\end{itemize}

7)If the results seem original:
\begin{itemize}
\item then report, go to 8)
\item else "reject, results are known(show how -from literature-), *STOP*
\end{itemize}

8)If there are sufficiently many details for an exact check of 
\begin{enumerate}
\item then report, go to 9)
\item else "the paper contains too few details(what is missing?) for an exact check of correctness", *STOP*
	
	If by intuitive reasons the paper or results seem correct:
	\begin{itemize}
\item	then report, go to 11)
\item	else "results(which) seem incorrect(Why)" *STOP*
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
	
9) Read the paper in detail(around 2-5 hours)

10)If the paper is technically correct and the author seems to master the field
\begin{itemize}
\item then report "the author masters the field; I have checked(all, most, some -which-) details(in detail, spot checked etc.)", make a list of minor problems, go to 11)
\item else "reject, the paper contains possible severe errors(which)" *STOP*
\end{itemize}

11)If the presentation, style and format are of high standard:
\begin{itemize}
\item then report "the presentation is (good,standard,excellent), go to 12)
\item else suggest improvements, signal errors, go to 12)
\end{itemize}

12)Make a list of suggestions for improving the paper + Decision
